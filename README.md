# Surfs Up!

For an upcoming trip to Hawii, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to perform a climate (Precipitation & Station) analysis and data exploration of the climate database using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

For the Precipitation Analysis, I designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
For the Station Analysis, I designed a query to calculate the total number of stations, find the most active stations and retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs).
