To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area

Used Python and SQLAlchemy to perform a climate (Precipitation & Station) analysis and data exploration of Honolulu Hawaii's climate database using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

For the Precipitation Analysis, I designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
For the Station Analysis, designed a query to calculate the total number of stations, find the most active stations and retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs).
